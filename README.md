# Photo-Nuker-C
C implementation of my Java "Photo Nuker," accessible via command line.

Compilation instructions because I didn't have a makefile and did not remember the exact gcc command I reused :D

# Running
Provide the filename of the JPEG image file you would like to nuke (within same directory). Your nuked image will be located in the same directory as "output.jpg"
Example:
./final duck_image.jpg
